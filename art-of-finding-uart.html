  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I had access to an <a href="https://www.meetibi.com">Ibi</a> to play around with. The Ibi is a networked media storage device from Sandisk, which is now part of Western Digital. Sandisk bills the Ibi as a "personal cloud for your photos and videos." However, you can only use it with their Ibi smartphone app, and that app requires a ridiculous amount of permissions -- you might as well install a backdoor on your phone. I wanted to see what made the Ibi tick, and if it could be customized.</p>
<p>On the outside, the Ibi has a USB 3.0 port, power jack, and LED. There is no ethernet port, only WiFi, and no video output. Beyond that it's a black box (figuratively speaking, as it has a white case). What I needed was a serial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a> (universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter) connection to see device startup messages and information about its configuration. Many routers, switches, and other embedded devices have some sort of UART capability for troubleshooting and diagnostic purposes, and I hoped the Ibi would be the same.</p>
<p>I opened up the case, and the Ibi's innards slid out easily enough. There was a main <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board">PCB</a> with the hard drive underneath:</p>
<p><img src="images/ibi-main-pcb.jpg" alt="Image: Ibi main PCB" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p>Of most interest was the 4-pin header at J1 (circled in the image above), which I suspected was a UART. With the Ibi powered off, I used a multimeter to test J1's pins for ground, which turned out to be pin 4. Pins 2 and 3 had thin traces on the back of the PCB running towards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip">SoC</a> (see arrows in the image below). These were quite likely the transmit (TX) and receive (RX) pins: </p>
<p><img src="images/ibi-uart-traces.jpg" alt="Image: J1 header, pins 2 and 3 traces" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p>So pin 1 remained as the likely candidate for power (VCC). I powered up the device several times, measuring the voltage on pins 1, 2, and 3. Pins 1 and 3 remained steady at 3.3V, but the voltage on pin 2 fluctuated during startup. This was probably the TX pin shoveling out serial data.</p>
<p>Based on all of this information, at this point I was pretty confident that pin 1 = VCC, pin 2 = TX, pin 3 = RX, and 4 = GND. Before I hooked up my USB-UART adapter though, I used a logic analyzer to confirm my hypothesis. The analyzer's parser showed that there was indeed outgoing data that it could decode on pin 2:</p>
<p><img src="images/ibi-saleae-capture.png" alt="Image: Saleae Logic Analyzer serial parser capture" width="641" height="349"/></p>
<p>Next, I connected the USB-UART adapter and started <em>screen</em> at the standard 115200 baud rate:</p>

<p>I powered up the board, and was greeted with a stream of text as U-Boot and the kernel did their thing:</p>

<p>After startup completed, I arrived at a shell prompt as the root user:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>root@yodaplus32_mini:/ #
</pre></div>


<p>So the UART gave me what I needed -- visibility into the startup process, and a shell for looking around the filesystem. It turns out the Ibi uses a two-stage U-Boot loading process and runs Android. There is no SSH server (or even a text editor) installed, so it's a pretty bare-bones OS installation.</p>
<p>The bootup process indicates the CPU is a quad-core A53 ARM processor; looking at the board under the heatsink reveals a <a href="https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtd1295">Realtek RTD1295 SoC</a>. Unfortunately, Linux kernel support for the Realtek RTD1295 is patchy, though work appears to be picking up in that area. Hopefully in the near future, it will be possible to boot a vanilla kernel on the Ibi and get a full Linux distro running on it, as opposed to a locked-down Android install.</p></div>
